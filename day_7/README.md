# Assignment 7

## Task
Create a Java program that simulates a ticket reservation system for a movie theater.

## Requirements
- The program should have a single theater room with a fixed number of seats.
- Multiple users should be able to access the system simultaneously and try to reserve seats for a particular movie showtime.
- The system should enforce synchronization to ensure that only one user can reserve a seat at a time.
- If a seat is already reserved by another user, the system should notify the user and prompt them to choose another available seat. 
- Once a user successfully reserves a seat, the seat should be marked as unavailable for future reservations.
