# Task
Print numbers from 1 to 10 using two threads, where each thread prints alternate numbers.

## Requirements
- Create two threads, ThreadA and ThreadB.
- ThreadA should print odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) and ThreadB should print even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8, 10).
- Implement the logic to print the numbers inside the run() method of each thread.
- Synchronize the threads to ensure proper alternating printing.
- Start both threads and observe the output.
